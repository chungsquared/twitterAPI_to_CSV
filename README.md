# twitterAPI_to_CSV

Python script that makes a call to Twitter's Public API to get tweet information for a given topic. 

Information taken is:
  1. Tweet Message
  2. User ID
  3. Tweet Coordinates
  4. Number of Mentions
  5. Retweeted (boolean)
  6. Number of followers
  7. Number of Friends user has
  8. User's Profile Description
  9. User's Member Since
  10. Tweet's Created_at
  11. Tweet's Timezone

Once information is received, it is packaged and saved as a .csv file. I plan on taking the data in testing out 
on Splunk Lite's Platform for analysis.
